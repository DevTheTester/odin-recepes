    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wow your friends and family at the dinner table with this unorthodox twist on a staple dinner. Takes only 4-5 minutes of preparation per serving and guarantees to leave you guests speechless. Momofuku Ando from Ritsumeikan University in Japan is accredited as being the inventor of the instant ramen we know and love today, many believing the invention to be the greatest thing since sliced bread, which leads us to our next ingredient.
        
    Otto Fredrerick Rohwedder of Davenport, Iowa, United States, created the Yang to the Ying for our recipe so to speak. He invented the first single loaf bread-slicing machine and laid the groundwork for one of the most groundbreaking food combinations known to man.</p>
